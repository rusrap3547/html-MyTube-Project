			OP Crit BUILDS ARE BACK!!! With the release of the recent Remnant 2 DLC we
			have had to redo all our previous builds. Well, I am happy to say that
			ranged damage is still strong and breaking down bosses with ease. These
			are the TOP 5 BEST Ranged builds that I have been using here recently in
			Apocalypse. Each is based around a different playstyle, and all are very
			strong. You should definitely try out the bow build as the new instant
			fire is extremely easy to use and the damage is crazy high.
