			GUNDAM EVOLUTION will offer a 6v6 competitive team-play dynamic with
			playable mobile suits from across the Gundam multiverse. GUNDAM EVOLUTION
			is a free-to-play team-based first-person shooter featuring 6v6 PvP
			combat. The game will offer three objective-based game modes: Point
			Capture, Domination and Destruction. This game is basically a carbon copy
			of Overwatch with a different character format based on one of the most
			amazing anime.
