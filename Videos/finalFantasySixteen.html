      For centuries, people have flocked to her Mothercrystals to partake of
      their blessingâ€”the abundant aether that fuels the magicks they rely upon
      in their everyday lives. As the aether begins to fade and the lifeless
      deadlands spread ever further, so too does the struggle for possession of
      the final flickers of the Mothers' light grow ever more fierce. Yet amidst
      the gathering storm, there are those who believe that the legacy of the
      crystals has shaped mankind's destiny for long enough.
