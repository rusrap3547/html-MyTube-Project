    <p>
      This build is using another crit build that relies on the Monarch gun,
      This thing allows you have all your shots target a specific point without
      aiming, filling the secondary bar will increase its power. With the high
      fire rate and all the crit ability you will be able to get a lot more
      bleed damage.
