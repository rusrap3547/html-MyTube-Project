      In Cornelia, a land covered in darkness, Jack and his allies Jed and Ash
      embark on a journey to defeat Chaos. Each of them think only of defeating
      Chaos as they continually slay one monster after another, like an
      unquenchable thirst. Though they are thought of as Cornelia's saviors, the
      crystals they possess to help them on their journey are black in color.
      Are they the Warriors of the Light the prophecy foretold?
