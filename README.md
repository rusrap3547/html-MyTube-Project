üì£ Getting Started
You'll need to use a code editor for this project such as Visual Studio Code or another editor of your choice.
You will pick your own genre of video collections for this website. This could be a "MyTube" about cats, cars, sports... anything.
Each collection of videos will have its own category type of videos. For example, you might have a collection of sports videos, motorcycle videos, and adorable cat videos üò∏
For each video, embed YouTube videos.
The layout DOES NOT need to match the mockup below. The mockup simply is used to give you an idea of what elements to include on each page. 
You can use HTML tables for basic layout if you want -- it is not required. The goal is to have all required HTML elements as shown in the mockup.

üõ† Requirements
This is to be done with HTML ONLY. (For your Module 2 project you'll be tasked with adding CSS to this MyTube project).
The index.html  file will be the "home page" of your website.
Your website will have four (4) pages. The navbar will include 4 links to get to these different pages:
Home page: This will show 3 "featured" videos (1 from each collection) - Videos on this page SHOULD NOT be allowed full screen.
Collection pages: 
You will have three (3) collections/category pages.
Each page will have a collection of YouTube videos of your choice (i.e. Cars).
Each collection page will have six (6) videos relevant to the collection/category.
Videos on this page SHOULD NOT be allowed full screen.
Each YouTube video will have a clickable title beneath it that navigates the user to its "video details page"
Video details page:
This page should include the YouTube video associated with the title that was clicked, along with its title and a short paragraph about the video. You can use lorem ipsum text for video descriptions.
Videos on this page WILL be allowed full screen.
Video Upload page:
This will include a form (non-functional) to mimic "uploading" videos to your channel.
The <input> and <label> elements should include ALL required attributes as if it were a working form.
Pay special attention to the form mockup below to know what elements the form must include.
The radio buttons must toggle correctly (one selected at a time)
HTML must follow a consistent indentation pattern. (HTML style guide)
No large gaps/empty space between elements.
Footer - Place an <hr> tag just above the <footer> and add the following text inside the footer: &copy; Copyright"
Read these requirements again before submitting your assignment to make sure you have covered each point.


üìÅ Project structure
Create a project folder with an index.html and form.html file at the root of the project folder. The index file will be your "Home Page".
Create two (2) directories
"pages" - this will contain .html files for each "video collection" page. There should be 3 files in this directory. (i.e. sports.html, music.html, fitness.html).
"videos" -  this will contain .html files for each videos "details" page (Hint - You'll have 3 collection pages with 6 videos in each. That means this directory will have 18 html files (i.e. video-1.html, video-2.html, etc...)
