				For centuries, people have flocked to her Mothercrystals to partake of
				their blessingâ€”the abundant aether that fuels the magicks they rely upon
				in their everyday lives. As the aether begins to fade and the lifeless
				deadlands spread ever further, so too does the struggle for possession
				of the final flickers of the Mothers' light grow ever more fierce. Yet
				amidst the gathering storm, there are those who believe that the legacy
				of the crystals has shaped mankind's destiny for long enough.
