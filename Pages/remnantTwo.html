				OP Crit BUILDS ARE BACK!!! With the release of the recent Remnant 2 DLC
				we have had to redo all our previous builds. Well, I am happy to say
				that ranged damage is still strong and breaking down bosses with ease.
				These are the TOP 5 BEST Ranged builds that I have been using here
				recently in Apocalypse. Each is based around a different playstyle, and
				all are very strong. You should definitely try out the bow build as the
				new instant fire is extremely easy to use and the damage is crazy high.

			<h2>Death by a thousand Cuts</h2>

			<p>
				This build is using another crit build that relies on the Monarch gun,
				This thing allows you have all your shots target a specific point
				without aiming, filling the secondary bar will increase its power. With
				the high fire rate and all the crit ability you will be able to get a
				lot more bleed damage.

				Back with another fun thematic Build ðŸ¤  this character focus around
				using "quickdraw" for big Weakspot damage I can hit around 5k on

			<h2>Acid Builds simply melt the competition.</h2>
			<iframe
				src="/Videos/remnantAcidBuild.html"
				frameborder="0"
				width="384"

				scrolling="no"></iframe>
			<p>
				The reason Acid builds are so great is they bypass armor and sometimes
				even stack on themselves. Adding to that Crit chance will always buff
				your dps across the board.

			<h2>Trinity Sniper Crossbow</h2>

			<p>
				Utilizing the Eclipse Protocol gear set, this build excels in leveraging
				status effects to control crowds and amplify damage, making it ideal for
				tackling challenging content alone. Its combination of massive damage
				and enhanced survivability ensures players can efficiently manage tough
				PvE scenarios.
